\# FUTURE\_CS\_03 - Secure File Sharing System (AES-256-GCM)



\## 📖 Overview

As part of my cybersecurity internship with \*\*Future Interns\*\*, this project focused on building a secure file-sharing system using \*\*AES-256-GCM encryption\*\*.  

The goal was to ensure \*\*confidentiality, integrity, and controlled access\*\* of uploaded files while learning how encryption and secure key handling are applied in real-world applications.



This project simulates how sensitive data can be securely stored and retrieved, a critical skill in cybersecurity engineering.

\## ✅ Key Highlights

\- Implemented \*\*AES-256-GCM encryption\*\* for file confidentiality.

\- Built a \*\*Flask web application\*\* with secure upload \& download features.

\- Integrated \*\*environment variables (.env)\*\* for key management.

\- Practiced secure coding practices (input validation, metadata handling).

\- Learned file encryption/decryption and secure key usage.

\## 🎯 Skills Gained

\- Secure file storage \& encryption

\- Web application security practices

\- Environment variable \& secret key handling

\- Flask framework basics

\- Debugging and secure deployment
