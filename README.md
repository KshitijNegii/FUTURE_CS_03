# 🔐 FUTURE_CS_03 - Secure File Sharing System (AES-GCM)

## 📖 Overview
As part of my cybersecurity internship with **Future Interns**, this project focused on building a **Secure File Sharing System**.  
The application ensures confidentiality and integrity of files using **AES-256-GCM encryption** and provides a secure way to upload, store, and download files.

This project simulates how organizations can protect sensitive data in transit and at rest.

---

## ✅ Key Highlights
- Implemented **AES-256-GCM encryption** for secure file storage.  
- Built a **Flask-based web portal** for file upload & download.  
- Managed **encryption keys and secrets** using environment variables (`.env`).  
- Added features to **list uploaded files, download securely, and handle metadata**.  
- Practiced **secure coding** with Python and Flask.

## 🎯 Skills Gained
- Cryptography (AES-GCM)  
- Secure web application development (Flask, Python)  
- File handling & metadata management  
- Environment variables & secrets management  
- Cybersecurity best practices for web apps  

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
